#  Starter Project for Part III of iOS Unit Testing by Example

Part III of
[iOS Unit Testing by Example](https://pragprog.com/titles/jrlegios/ios-unit-testing-by-example/)
includes some really cool refactoring exercises.

But first you have to spend 10 pages setting up a your Xcode project from scratch.

Since I had to do it, I thought I'd save you the trouble. Here is the complete project,
ready for you to add unit tests and start refactoring. Just read the first page and a
half of of Chapter 17, then skip straight to page 220 and begin the section "Replace
the Difficult Dependency with a Mock Object."

Good luck!
